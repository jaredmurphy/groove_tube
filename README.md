# GrooveTube

###Description###

GrooveTube is a work-in-process Youtube clone, using the Youtube API to search for terms and display a video player and related videos created with React Components.

Using dynamic react components, this app is able to update the page upon user input without a submit button or clicking enter, and using Lodash is able to throttle the API call so a new search does not occur on every single character typed.

Clicking on a related video will display that video in the media player.

###Currently Working On###

Adding functionality to rerender related videos component when one is selected from the options.

###Tech###
Node.js, React, Lodash, Babel (to compile ES6), Bootstrap for styling
